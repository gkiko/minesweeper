Functional Minesweeper in C#
==========================

* Unlike many other mini projects it's fully functional and bug free.
* But it is not about what it does, it's about code.
* The code is written in C#, but in a very functional programming manner - that's what some call "functionalish".


This project is basically useless without explanation, but I doubt I will find time to write down anything.
